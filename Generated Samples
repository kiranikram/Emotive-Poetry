Given the same context from Daffodils by William Wordsworth, the model generated:

A man of his station was not to be outdone,
A wise man would not be so careless:
He should have been more careful of his words,
And never made any mistake.
I am sure you have heard of the shipwrecked Of a ship that went down in the sea;
But how did you find it?
You were on a beach,
And it was a pretty rough day.
It was a pretty rough day.

And:

The next day the sun was still shining,
And I felt more than ever.
I sat on the beach,
And stared at the sea and the sea-flowers.
It was as if I had been a child again.
The tide turned out to be too strong;
I was out of luck.
The tide turned out to be too strong;
I was out of luck.
The sun came up again, and I was back home.
